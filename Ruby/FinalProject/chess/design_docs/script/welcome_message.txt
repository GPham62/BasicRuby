Welcome to chess! In this version of the game, 2 human players will play against each other.
Pick which player will be the white pieces, and which player will be the black pieces.
The white player will go first. On your turn, you can move a chess piece, save and quit, or quit.
If you elect to move a piece, you will be prompted to choose a chess piece to move. Pick a piece 
to move by typing the coordinates and pressing enter. For example, type a2 and then press Enter. 
If that chess piece is allowed to move this turn, you will be prompted to pick from one of its 
available moves. Enter the move in the same way you would to select a piece.

The game can be won by checkmating your opponent's king. Good luck!
