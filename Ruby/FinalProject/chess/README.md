# Ruby Final Project - Chess

This 'capstone' project in the ruby curriculum at The Odin Project is a command-line chess game for two. The project is mostly
complete, but I decided to move on without implementing en passant capture and castling. The main challenges this project 
presented pertained to the organization of the code and communication between classes. Implementing the rules of the game and check mate was difficult as well. Though for all the challenges faced, the most striking thing about this project was my realization that I had never played a game of chess ***in my life***; I guess I was raised in a checkers family.
